>This projects helps sellers or buyers to predict the price of used cars so easily.
>I have created a machine learning project, where users can find out there used car prices with giving few inputs like present price of ca in ex-showroom,year of purchase,fuel type etc. I have downloaded the dataset from kaggle. 
 - In this Project, we are going to predict the Price of Used Cars using various features.
 - I made a machine learning model that predicts the selling price of the used car, the web app is built using streamlit and deployed on Streamlit. 
 - If you want to view the model click on link : https://kartikeybhadouria-car-price-prediction-app-sd7gyr.streamlit.app/
 - During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, feature engineering, randomsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning,      cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,
    - Python
    - Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
    - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
    - Sklearn for model building
    - Jupyter notebook, visual studio code as IDE
    - Streamlit to built, deploy and manage web app
